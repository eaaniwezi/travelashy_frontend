# travelashy_frontend

An app that allows adventurers to post pictures of interesting places they visit

At the front end, I used flutter in consuming all the endpoints created.

At the backend, I built a RESTFUL API using JavaScript(NodeJS) to handle all the necessary endpoints needed to be consumed on the app.
I also made use of a Non-Relational Database to store the users' details.


Used: JS(NodeJS), RESTFUL API, Dart(Flutter), NoSQL(MongoDb), Git, PostMan
